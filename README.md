## Overview
Festival Scheduling mobile App developed for a London-based festival blogger as a project at University College London. At the current state, the source code cannot be released. Please see the the festUp.pdf for a more detaile description and screenshots of the App.

## Background
Despite an ever-increasing technology trend, medium-sized festivals lack resources to offer mobile Apps to their visitors, imposing large organizational difficulties. In cooperation with University College London and our industry client - a London-based festival blogger - it was our aim to develop a Festival Scheduling App. A key goal was to develop a generic App that can be offered at a number of medium-sized festivals rather than at one specific event.
